# SecureBank Framework

SecureBank is a decision framework designed to quantify how cyber risk propagates into financial and regulatory exposure in high-compliance environments.

## What this is
- A board-level decision framework
- A structured approach to systemic risk propagation and impact quantification

## What this is NOT
- Not a generic compliance checklist
- Not an off-the-shelf product
- Not a public “framework for everyone”

## Who it is for
Executives, risk leaders, audit leaders, and security architects working in regulated financial or critical environments.

## Relationship to implementations
This repository documents the framework (method and governance). Technical implementations and PoCs live in separate repositories.
