# SecureBank Framework

SecureBank is a decision framework designed to quantify how cyber risk propagates into financial and regulatory exposure in high-compliance environments.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository presents **SecureBank**, a decision-centric cybersecurity framework designed to support executive and board-level risk evaluation.

The focus of SecureBank is not on detecting threats, but on enabling **informed, timely, and measurable decisions** when cyber risk materializes.

---

## What This Is

- A conceptual and architectural framework  
- A board-level decision framework  
- Focused on decision-making, not threat detection  
- A structured approach to systemic risk propagation and impact quantification  
- Intended for highly regulated financial and critical environments  

---

## What This Is Not

- Not a security tool  
- Not a compliance checklist  
- Not a detection, SOC, or monitoring framework  
- Not a generic “one-size-fits-all” cybersecurity model  

---

## Framework Scope

SecureBank addresses a critical gap in cybersecurity governance:

Most cybersecurity frameworks evaluate **controls, maturity, or technical risk in isolation**.  
SecureBank focuses on a different question:

> **“If this cyber risk materializes, what is the financial and regulatory impact, and what decisions must be taken now?”**

---

## How the Framework Is Organized

The framework is structured around a **layered decision model**, documenting how risk propagates across organizational and operational boundaries:

- Identity and authentication assumptions  
- Risk analytics and decision thresholds  
- Transaction authorization and exposure  
- Payment, settlement, and downstream financial impact  
- Governance and board-level decision outcomes  

Detailed documentation is available in the `/framework` directory.

## How to Review This Framework

Reviewers are encouraged to focus on:

- The logical consistency of the layered decision model  
- How technical risk propagates into financial and regulatory exposure  
- The clarity and usefulness of executive-level decision outputs  
- Conceptual originality compared to existing cybersecurity and risk frameworks  

This repository is intentionally **implementation-agnostic**.

---

## Request for Technical and Academic Review

This project is open for independent technical and academic review.

Feedback on structure, assumptions, decision logic, and governance alignment is welcome.

---

## Who This Framework Is For

- Executives and board members  
- Risk and audit leaders  
- Security architects and governance professionals  
- Organizations operating in regulated financial or critical infrastructure environments  

---

## Relationship to Implementations

This repository documents the **framework, methodology, and governance model**.

Technical implementations, simulations, and proofs of concept are intentionally maintained in **separate repositories**.
