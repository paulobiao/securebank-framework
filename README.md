# SecureBank Framework

SecureBank is a decision framework designed to quantify how cyber risk propagates into financial and regulatory exposure in high-compliance environments.
## Purpose of This Repository
This repository presents SecureBank, a decision-centric cybersecurity framework designed for executive and board-level risk evaluation.

## What This Is
- A conceptual and architectural framework
- Focused on decision-making, not threat detection
- Intended for high-regulation environments

## What This Is Not
- Not a security tool
- Not a compliance checklist
- Not a detection or SOC framework

## Seeking Technical Review
This project is open for independent technical and academic review.
Feedback on structure, assumptions, and decision logic is welcome.

## What this is
- A board-level decision framework
- A structured approach to systemic risk propagation and impact quantification

## What this is NOT
- Not a generic compliance checklist
- Not an off-the-shelf product
- Not a public “framework for everyone”

## Who it is for
Executives, risk leaders, audit leaders, and security architects working in regulated financial or critical environments.

## Relationship to implementations
This repository documents the framework (method and governance). Technical implementations and PoCs live in separate repositories.
