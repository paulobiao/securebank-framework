# SecureBank™ Framework

SecureBank™ is a decision-grade framework for modeling how cyber risk
propagates into systemic financial and regulatory exposure in highly
regulated environments.

Rather than treating cyber risk as an isolated technical event,
SecureBank models cyber failure as a time-dependent, system-wide
phenomenon with direct executive, financial, and regulatory consequences.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository documents SecureBank™ as a **conceptual, architectural,
and governance framework** designed to support **executive and board-level
decision-making** under cyber risk.

SecureBank does **not** focus on threat detection or operational monitoring.
Its purpose is to enable **defensible, timely, and measurable decisions**
once cyber risk materializes — before losses, regulatory breaches, or
systemic failures escalate.

---

## What SecureBank Is

- A **reference framework** for systemic cyber risk modeling
- A **decision-centric methodology** for executive and board use
- Technology-agnostic and implementation-independent
- Focused on **risk propagation**, **impact quantification**, and
  **decision accountability**
- Designed for **financially regulated and critical infrastructure
  environments**

---

## What SecureBank Is Not

- Not a security product or software tool
- Not a detection, SOC, or monitoring framework
- Not a compliance checklist or maturity model
- Not a vendor-specific or one-size-fits-all solution

---

## Framework Scope

SecureBank addresses a structural gap in cybersecurity governance:

Most existing frameworks evaluate controls, maturity, or technical risk
in isolation. They rarely answer the question that defines executive and
regulatory accountability:

> **If this cyber risk materializes, what is the financial and regulatory
> impact — and what decisions must be taken now?**

SecureBank is explicitly designed to answer that question.

---

## Framework Structure

The framework is organized as a layered decision model that documents how
cyber risk propagates across organizational, operational, and governance
boundaries, including:

- Identity and authentication assumptions
- Risk analytics and decision thresholds
- Transaction authorization and exposure
- Payment, settlement, and downstream financial impact
- Governance, escalation, and board-level decision outcomes

Detailed documentation is available in the `/framework` directory.

## Evaluation and Review

SecureBank™ is intentionally **implementation-agnostic** and designed to be
**evaluated independently**.

Reviewers are encouraged to focus on:

- Logical consistency of the layered decision model
- How technical risk propagates into financial and regulatory exposure
- Clarity and usefulness of executive-level decision outputs
- Conceptual originality relative to existing cybersecurity and risk frameworks

---

## Request for Independent Review

This project is open to **independent technical and academic review**.

Feedback on framework structure, assumptions, decision logic, and governance
alignment is welcome and encouraged.

---

## Intended Audience

- Executives and board members
- Risk, audit, and compliance leaders
- Security architects and governance professionals
- Organizations operating in regulated financial or critical infrastructure
  environments

---

## Relationship to Implementations

This repository documents the **framework, methodology, and governance model**.

Technical implementations, simulations, and proofs of concept are
intentionally maintained in **separate repositories** and referenced only
as supporting validation artifacts.
