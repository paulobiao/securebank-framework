# Risk Propagation Methodology

## Objective
This section describes how cyber risk propagates from technical events into business, financial, and regulatory exposure.

The goal is not to measure likelihood or technical severity, but to map **impact pathways**.

---

## Risk Propagation Concept
Cyber risk rarely materializes as a single isolated event.

Instead, it propagates across organizational layers:

1. Technical failure or compromise  
2. Operational disruption  
3. Business process impact  
4. Financial exposure  
5. Regulatory and legal consequences  

SecureBank models this propagation explicitly to support decision-making.

---

## Example Propagation Chain
A simplified example:

- Identity compromise  
→ Unauthorized transaction  
→ Financial loss  
→ Regulatory reporting obligation  
→ Board-level decision and remediation strategy

The value of the framework lies in making this chain visible **before** an incident occurs.

---

## Why Traditional Models Fail
Most risk assessments stop at:
- Control effectiveness
- Technical severity
- Compliance status

They fail to represent:
- Cross-domain propagation
- Decision ownership
- Timing of executive action

SecureBank addresses this gap by structuring risk as a **decision-impact chain**.
