# Board-Level Usage of the SecureBank Framework

## Purpose
This section defines how the SecureBank Framework is intended to be used
by boards, executive committees, and senior risk leadership as a
governance instrument for accountable cyber risk decision-making.


SecureBank is not a reporting tool.
It is a **decision-support mechanism**.

---

## Target Audience
The framework is designed for:

- Board members
- Executive risk committees
- C-level leadership
- Senior compliance and legal stakeholders

It is intentionally **not** designed for SOC analysts or operational teams.

---

## Decision Context
SecureBank is used when leadership must answer questions such as:

- Should this risk be accepted, mitigated, transferred, or escalated?
- What is the financial and regulatory exposure if no action is taken?
- Which decisions must be made now versus later?
- Who owns the decision at the executive level?

---

## How SecureBank Is Used in Practice
A typical usage flow:

1. A cyber risk scenario is identified
2. Risk propagation paths are mapped
3. Financial and regulatory impacts are estimated
4. Decision options are presented to leadership
5. A documented executive decision is made

The framework supports **clarity, accountability, and timing**.

---

## What SecureBank Does Not Do
SecureBank does **not**:

- Replace security controls
- Assess technical vulnerabilities
- Provide compliance certification
- Automate incident response

Its value lies in enabling **informed executive judgment**.

---

## Governance Value
By formalizing risk-to-decision pathways, SecureBank establishes a
repeatable governance mechanism that:


- Reduces ambiguity in board discussions
- Aligns cyber risk with business language
- Creates auditable decision records
- Improves regulatory defensibility
