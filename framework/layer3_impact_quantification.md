# Layer 3 — Impact Quantification

## Purpose

This layer quantifies how propagated and amplified cyber failures
materialize as measurable impact over time.

Its objective is to transform abstract cyber risk into decision-relevant
impact metrics that can be compared, prioritized, and governed.

---

## Core Question

If this cyber risk continues to propagate, what is the magnitude,
accumulation rate, and irreversibility of its impact?

---

## Analytical Scope

This layer focuses on:

- Impact accumulation over time
- Differentiation between reversible and irreversible loss
- Scaling effects driven by dependency structures
- Decision delay penalties

It does not perform cost estimation for specific vendors or controls.

---

## Impact Dimensions

Impact is quantified across multiple dimensions, which may include:

- Financial exposure
- Operational disruption
- Customer and market impact
- Regulatory escalation thresholds

The framework allows impact dimensions to be evaluated independently
and jointly.

---

## Quantification Principles

Impact quantification in SecureBank is guided by the following principles:

- Time matters more than static magnitude
- Small delays can produce disproportionate loss
- Impact accumulates non-linearly
- Some losses are irreversible regardless of later containment

All quantification assumptions are explicit and reviewable.

---

## Outputs

This layer produces:

- Time-based impact curves
- Expected and maximum plausible impact ranges
- Decision thresholds based on impact acceleration

These outputs serve as inputs for regulatory and governance analysis.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This layer does not:

- Replace financial accounting models
- Predict exact loss values
- Guarantee precision over uncertainty

Its purpose is to support defensible decision-making under uncertainty.
