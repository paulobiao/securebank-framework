# SecureBank Decision Model

## Purpose

The SecureBank Decision Model is designed to support executive and board-level decision-making by translating cyber risk events into quantifiable financial and regulatory exposure.

This model does not aim to detect threats or replace security controls. Its purpose is to answer a different question:

**“If this cyber risk materializes, what is the business and regulatory impact, and what decisions must be taken now?”**

---

## Problem Statement

Most cybersecurity frameworks focus on controls, maturity, or technical risk scoring. While valuable, they fail to address a critical gap:

- Cyber risk is assessed in isolation
- Financial, operational, and regulatory impacts are treated as downstream consequences
- Executive decisions are made without a unified risk propagation view

As a result, organizations often discover the true cost of cyber risk **after** an incident, not before.

---

## Decision-Centric Approach

SecureBank introduces a decision-first model.

Instead of asking:
- “Are we compliant?”
- “Is this control implemented?”

The model asks:
- “What decision is required if this risk propagates?”
- “What financial thresholds are crossed?”
- “Which regulatory obligations are triggered?”

This shift reframes cybersecurity from a technical discipline into a governance and capital allocation problem.

---

## Risk Propagation Logic

The model assumes that cyber risk propagates across four layers:

1. Technical compromise
2. Operational disruption
3. Financial exposure
4. Regulatory and supervisory impact

Each layer amplifies the previous one. SecureBank explicitly models this propagation to prevent underestimation of impact at the executive level.

---

## Decision Outputs

The SecureBank Decision Model produces outputs designed for non-technical stakeholders:

- Financial exposure ranges
- Regulatory escalation triggers
- Decision urgency indicators
- Board-level risk narratives

These outputs are intentionally not expressed as technical scores or vulnerability metrics.

---

## Intended Audience

This model is designed for:

- Board members
- Executive leadership
- Risk committees
- Internal audit and governance functions

It is **not** intended to replace operational security tooling or engineering analysis.

---

## Scope Limitations

SecureBank does not:

- Perform threat detection
- Replace SIEM, SOAR, or fraud engines
- Provide control-level implementation guidance

Its value exists strictly at the decision and governance layer.
