# SecureBank — Decision-First Rationale
> This document describes the conceptual rationale behind SecureBank’s
> decision-first approach. The formal decision and resilience model
> is defined in `layer5_decision_resilience.md`.


## Purpose
SecureBank is a decision-centric framework designed to support executive and board-level decision-making by translating cyber risk events into business and regulatory impact.

It does not aim to detect threats or replace security controls.
Its purpose is to answer a different question:

**“If this cyber risk materializes, what is the business and regulatory impact, and what decisions must be taken now?”**

## Problem Statement
Most cybersecurity frameworks focus on controls, maturity models, or technical risk scoring.

While valuable, they fail to address a critical gap:
- Cyber risk is assessed in isolation
- Business and regulatory impacts are treated as downstream consequences
- Executive decisions are made without a unified risk propagation view

As a result, organizations often discover the true cost of cyber risk **after** an incident, not before.

## Decision-First Approach
SecureBank introduces a decision-first model.

Instead of asking:
- “Are we compliant?”
- “Is this control implemented?”

SecureBank asks:
- “What decision must be made if this fails tomorrow?”
- “Who owns the decision?”
- “What is the exposure if no action is taken?”
