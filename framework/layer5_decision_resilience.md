# Layer 5 — Decision & Resilience Modeling

## Purpose

This layer transforms systemic cyber risk analysis into explicit,
defensible decision options and resilience strategies.

Its objective is to support accountable decision-making under uncertainty
by making trade-offs, timing, and consequences transparent.

---

## Core Question

Given the modeled propagation, impact, and regulatory exposure,
what decisions should be taken now to preserve resilience and accountability?

---

## Analytical Scope

This layer focuses on:

- Decision timing and urgency
- Trade-offs between security, continuity, and cost
- Resilience preservation versus loss acceptance
- Accountability and decision ownership

It does not prescribe a single correct decision.

---

## Decision Modeling Approach

Decisions are modeled as structured options rather than binary choices,
including:

- Immediate containment
- Partial isolation
- Controlled degradation
- Continued operation with monitored exposure

Each option is evaluated based on impact reduction, regulatory exposure,
and resilience preservation.

---

## Resilience Considerations

Resilience is evaluated as the system’s ability to:

- Absorb disruption without systemic collapse
- Maintain critical functions
- Recover within acceptable timeframes
- Preserve governance and trust

Resilience trade-offs are made explicit rather than implicit.

---

## Outputs

This layer produces:

- Decision option sets
- Explicit trade-off matrices
- Decision windows and escalation points
- Resilience preservation indicators

These outputs close the decision loop of the SecureBank framework.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This layer does not:

- Automate executive decisions
- Eliminate uncertainty
- Replace leadership judgment

Its purpose is to support defensible and accountable decision-making.
