# SecureBank — Definition

SecureBank™ is a decision-grade framework that models how cyber and
transactional risks propagate across interconnected systems and
materialize as financial and regulatory exposure.

The framework is designed to support executive and board-level
decision-making by transforming technical risk signals into measurable,
time-dependent impact and defensible decision options.

SecureBank is intentionally technology-agnostic, implementation-independent,
and applicable to highly regulated financial and critical infrastructure
environments.
