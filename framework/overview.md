# SecureBank™ Framework Overview

SecureBank™ is a systemic decision framework designed to model how cyber
risk propagates across interconnected systems and materializes as financial,
regulatory, and governance exposure.

The framework is structured to support executive accountability by making
cyber risk propagation, impact accumulation, and decision trade-offs explicit
before incidents escalate.

---

## Design Principles

SecureBank is guided by the following principles:

- Decision-first, not control-first
- Systemic impact over isolated technical events
- Financial and regulatory relevance as primary outputs
- Technology-agnostic and implementation-independent
- Explicit assumptions and bounded uncertainty

---

## Layered Decision Architecture

SecureBank is organized as a layered decision architecture.
Each layer transforms inputs into progressively higher-order
decision-relevant outputs.

The layers are:

1. Threat Propagation  
2. Systemic Dependencies  
3. Impact Quantification  
4. Regulatory Exposure  
5. Decision & Resilience Modeling  

Each layer is analytically independent but logically connected.

## How the Layers Interact

SecureBank does not assume linear escalation.
Instead, it models how failures propagate, amplify, or are contained
across layers depending on system structure and decision timing.

Outputs from each layer inform subsequent layers while preserving
traceability and accountability.

---

## Scope and Boundaries

SecureBank is intentionally scoped to:

- High-impact, regulated environments
- Executive and board-level decision contexts
- Strategic and governance decision horizons

The framework does not attempt to replace operational security tools,
detection systems, or compliance programs.

## Intended Use

SecureBank is intended to be used as:

- A reference framework for systemic cyber risk modeling
- A decision-support instrument for executive leadership
- A basis for independent evaluation and comparative analysis
