# Layer 4 — Regulatory Exposure

## Purpose

This layer models how quantified cyber impact translates into regulatory,
legal, and supervisory exposure as defined by applicable governance and
compliance regimes.

Its objective is to make regulatory escalation predictable, explicit,
and decision-relevant before formal violations occur.

---

## Core Question

At what point does cyber impact trigger regulatory obligations,
supervisory scrutiny, or legal exposure?

---

## Analytical Scope

This layer focuses on:

- Regulatory notification thresholds
- Escalation timelines and deadlines
- Supervisory intervention triggers
- Accountability and governance obligations

It does not provide legal advice or interpret specific statutes.

---

## Regulatory Modeling Approach

Regulatory exposure is modeled as a function of:

- Impact magnitude and duration
- Breach notification thresholds
- Operational resilience requirements
- Governance and accountability expectations

The framework abstracts regulatory regimes into evaluable escalation
patterns rather than jurisdiction-specific rules.

---

## Key Assumptions

- Regulatory obligations are time-bound
- Delayed decisions increase exposure
- Impact accumulation accelerates escalation
- Accountability cannot be retroactively delegated

All assumptions are explicit and subject to review.

---

## Outputs

This layer produces:

- Regulatory escalation curves
- Notification and response deadlines
- Decision windows for compliance-preserving action

These outputs inform governance and resilience decisions.

---

## Boundary Conditions

This layer does not:

- Replace legal counsel
- Interpret jurisdiction-specific regulations
- Provide compliance certification

Its purpose is to support defensible decision-making under regulatory pressure.
