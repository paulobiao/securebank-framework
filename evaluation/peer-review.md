# Peer Review and External Evaluation

## Purpose
This section defines how the SecureBank Framework is intended to be reviewed, evaluated, and challenged by independent professionals.

The goal is not academic publication, but **expert validation of decision logic**.

## Reviewer Profile
Reviewers should have experience in one or more of the following areas:

- Cybersecurity governance
- Enterprise risk management
- Financial risk oversight
- Regulatory compliance
- Executive decision-making

The framework is intentionally open to cross-disciplinary review.

---

## Scope of Review
Reviewers are encouraged to evaluate:

- Conceptual clarity of the decision model
- Soundness of risk propagation logic
- Practical applicability at board level
- Alignment with real-world governance challenges

They are not expected to validate technical controls or code.

## Review Method
Reviews may occur through:

- Written expert feedback
- Professional community discussion
- Case-based analysis
- Structured peer commentary

Both formal and documented expert reviews are considered valid,
provided they are independent, attributable, and preserved as
verifiable records.

## Review Outcomes
Feedback from reviewers may result in:

- Clarification of decision pathways
- Refinement of assumptions
- Expansion of governance use cases
- Documentation of limitations

All meaningful feedback is documented and versioned.

## Transparency
The SecureBank Framework embraces critical and independent review.
Disagreement, challenge, and dissenting opinions are considered
essential to its maturation and credibility.
