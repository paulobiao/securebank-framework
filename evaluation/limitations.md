# Framework Limitations

SecureBank™ is designed to support decision-making under uncertainty.
Like any analytical framework, it operates under explicit assumptions
and bounded scope.

## Known Limitations

- SecureBank does not predict exact loss values.
- Impact estimates depend on the quality of dependency mapping.
- Regulatory abstraction may not capture jurisdiction-specific nuances.
- Decision outputs support judgment but do not replace leadership accountability.

These limitations are intentional and preserve the framework’s
technology-agnostic and evaluable nature.
