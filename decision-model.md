# SecureBank Decision Model

## 1. Objective

SecureBank is a decision-centric framework designed to translate cyber risk into **financial, regulatory, and systemic impact**, enabling executive and board-level decision-making **before** incidents materialize.

This framework does **not** aim to:
- Detect threats
- Replace security controls
- Compete with technical security frameworks

Its sole objective is to answer the following executive question:

> **If this cyber risk materializes, what is the immediate business, financial, and regulatory impact — and what decisions must leadership take now?**

---

## 2. Core Problem

Most cybersecurity approaches suffer from three structural limitations:

1. Cyber risk is assessed in isolation from business and regulatory consequences  
2. Financial and compliance impacts are treated as downstream effects  
3. Executive decisions are made without a unified risk propagation model  

As a result, organizations often understand the **true cost of cyber risk only after an incident occurs**, when options are already constrained.

---

## 3. Decision-First Paradigm

SecureBank introduces a **decision-first** paradigm.

Instead of starting with controls, maturity levels, or compliance checklists, the model starts with:

- Executive decisions
- Regulatory exposure
- Financial loss thresholds
- Systemic risk propagation

Technical controls are evaluated **only in terms of how they influence decision outcomes**, not as standalone objectives.

---

## 4. Risk Propagation Logic

SecureBank models cyber risk as a **propagating event**, moving through four layers:

1. Technical Failure  
2. Operational Disruption  
3. Financial Exposure  
4. Regulatory and Systemic Impact  

Each layer amplifies constraints on leadership decisions and reduces available response options over time.

---

## 5. Executive Output

The model produces decision-oriented outputs, such as:

- Financial exposure ranges  
- Regulatory breach likelihood  
- Decision urgency indicators  
- Accept / Mitigate / Transfer / Escalate recommendations  

Outputs are intentionally designed for **boards, executives, regulators, and auditors**, not technical teams.

---

## 6. Scope and Intended Use

SecureBank is intended for:

- Financial institutions  
- Highly regulated infrastructures  
- Executive risk committees  
- Board-level cyber risk discussions  

It is **not** a compliance checklist and **not** an operational SOC tool.

---

## 7. Evaluation and Review

The framework is designed to be:

- Reviewable by independent experts  
- Discussed in professional and academic forums  
- Evaluated through peer review and case-based analysis  

Its value lies in **decision clarity**, not technical depth.
